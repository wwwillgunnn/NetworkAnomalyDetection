# 🧠 Intelligent Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic
This project detects anomalous patterns in network traffic using machine learning techniques, with the goal of identifying potential threats such as intrusions and unusual flows in real-time.

## 🚀 Features
- 📥 Ingests network flow data (e.g., from Zeek, pcap, NetFlow)
- 🧮 Extracts statistical features from flows or sessions
- 🤖 Applies machine learning models (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoder) to detect anomalies
- 🔔 Flags high-risk traffic for alerting or review or even block network traffic
- 📊 (Optional) Web dashboard for real-time anomaly monitoring and feedback

## 📈 How It Works
- Capture or load network traffic data (from dataset).
- Preprocess and extract features like bytes, packets, durations, etc.
- Normalize data to ensure consistent scale.
- Run anomaly detection models (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoder) on feature data.
- Score traffic and flag anything above the threshold as an anomaly.
- (Optional) Display results in a web dashboard or write to logs for review.
